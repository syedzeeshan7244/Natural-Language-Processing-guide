In Natural Language Processing (NLP), tokenization is the process of breaking up a piece of text into smaller units called tokens. These tokens are usually words, subwords, or characters, depending on the application.

Why Tokenization Is Important:

Tokenization is often the first step in NLP tasks. It simplifies text processing by dividing the text into manageable pieces for tasks like:

1. Text classification

2. Machine translation

3. Sentiment analysis

4. Named entity recognition (NER)


Types of Tokenization:

1. Word Tokenization
Splits text into words.
Example:

Input: "I love NLP."
Output: ["I", "love", "NLP", "."]

2. Subword Tokenization
Breaks words into smaller meaningful parts (useful for handling rare or unknown words).
Example (using Byte-Pair Encoding):

"unhappiness" → ["un", "happi", "ness"]

3. Character Tokenization

Splits text into individual characters.
Example:
"NLP" → ["N", "L", "P"]

4. Sentence Tokenization
Splits text into sentences.

"Hello. How are you?" → ["Hello.", "How are you?"]

Tools and Libraries:
Common Python libraries for tokenization include:

1. NLTK

2. spaCy

3. Hugging Face Tokenizers

4. TextBlob

from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
text = "Tokenization is important in NLP."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print(tokens)
# Output: ['Tokenization', 'is', 'important', 'in', 'NLP', '.']
